I want to build a clone of the app EzFill

AutoFill android & iOS mobile App Development Plan

Project Goal: Develop a production-ready, native android & iOS application for AutoFill using SwiftUI, adhering to modern development practices (MVVM, Combine, async/await), providing a seamless user experience for on-demand fuel ordering and delivery tracking, while ensuring security, performance, and scalability.

App Architecture (MVVM + SwiftUI + Combine)
Pattern: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

Model: Represents data structures (e.g., User, Vehicle, Order, FuelType). Plain Swift structs/classes, often Codable for API interaction. Resides in Models directory.

View: SwiftUI Views (struct conforming to View). Responsible for layout, presentation, and user interaction forwarding. Declares dependencies on ViewModels. Resides in Views directory, potentially grouped by feature.

ViewModel: ObservableObject classes. Contain presentation logic, state management (@Published properties), and interact with Services/Repositories. Expose data formatted for the View and handle user actions relayed from the View. Resides in ViewModels directory, often mirroring the View structure.

UI Framework: SwiftUI. Used for all UI components, leveraging its declarative nature, state management (@State, @StateObject, @ObservedObject, @EnvironmentObject), and composition capabilities.

Reactive Programming: Combine Framework. Used extensively within ViewModels to handle asynchronous operations (network requests, data persistence), bind data to UI elements (@Published properties), and manage complex event flows. async/await will be preferred for cleaner asynchronous code where applicable, often bridged with Combine where necessary (e.g., using .values on Publishers).

Modularity & Reusability:

Break down complex views into smaller, reusable SwiftUI components (e.g., VehicleCard, MapView, OrderSummaryRow). Reside in Views/Components.

Abstract business logic and data fetching into reusable Service or Repository layers.

Clean Code & Best Practices: Adhere to Swift style guides (e.g., Swift API Design Guidelines), SOLID principles where applicable, clear naming conventions, and minimize code duplication.

Key Features Implementation Details
a. Authentication:

UI: SwiftUI Views for Login (Email/Phone + Password), Signup (Email/Phone + Password + Confirmation), Profile Management (View/Edit), Password Reset (Request + Confirmation Code + New Password).
ViewModel: AuthViewModel managing state (credentials, loading, errors, loggedIn status). Uses AuthService.
Service: AuthService protocol/implementation handling API calls (login, signup, reset, fetch profile). Uses a NetworkService.
Security: Securely store authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) in Keychain. Implement token refresh logic. Use HTTPS for all API communication.
b. Vehicle Management:

UI: VehicleListView displaying user's vehicles. AddEditVehicleView form (Make, Model, Year dropdowns/pickers, Fuel Type selection, License Plate input). Delete confirmation alerts.
ViewModel: VehicleListViewModel fetching/displaying vehicles. AddEditVehicleViewModel handling form input, validation, and saving/updating via VehicleService.
Model: Vehicle struct (Codable).
Service: VehicleService handling CRUD operations via API calls.
License Plate Verification: Input validation (format mask). If deeper verification needed, requires an external API or backend check against relevant databases.
c. Ordering System:

UI: Multi-step ordering flow (Location -> Vehicle -> Fuel/Amount -> Schedule -> Confirmation). OrderHistoryView listing past orders. OrderDetailView.
ViewModel: OrderCreationViewModel managing state across steps. OrderHistoryViewModel fetching past orders.
Model: Order struct (Codable), FuelType enum/struct.
Service: OrderService handling order creation, fetching history, fetching real-time pricing based on location/fuel type via API. PricingService potentially separate.
Scheduling: Use DatePicker for future deliveries. Backend handles scheduling logic.
d. Location Services:

Frameworks: CoreLocation (requesting permissions, fetching current location). MapKit (displaying MKMapView via UIViewRepresentable or potentially native SwiftUI Map in android & iOS 16+ if appropriate).
UI: Interactive map for selecting/confirming delivery location (pin drop). Display driver location updates.
ViewModel: Manages location permissions state, current coordinate, updates map annotations. Uses LocationService.
Service: LocationService wrapping CLLocationManager logic, providing Combine publishers or async streams for location updates. GeocodingService (using CLGeocoder or external API like Mapbox/Google) for address lookup/validation. GeoFenceService (backend) checking if coordinates are within defined service areas.
e. Payment Integration:

SDK: Stripe android & iOS SDK is recommended. Handles UI for adding cards securely, tokenization, and processing payments. Supports Apple Pay (PassKit).
UI: PaymentMethodsView (list, add, select default). Payment sheet presentation during checkout. TransactionHistoryView.
ViewModel: PaymentViewModel interacting with Stripe SDK and backend PaymentService to save payment methods, create payment intents, and confirm payments.
Service: PaymentService (backend interaction) for creating payment intents, saving Stripe customer/payment method IDs, fetching transaction history.
Security: Client app never handles raw card details directly; relies on Stripe SDK tokenization. Backend handles payment processing securely.
f. Real-time Features:

WebSockets: Use URLSessionWebSocketTask or a library like Starscream/Socket.IO-Client-Swift to establish a WebSocket connection with the backend.
ViewModel: Subscribes to WebSocket messages for specific orders (status changes, driver location updates) and updates @Published properties.
Push Notifications: Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) via UserNotifications framework. Register device token with backend. Handle incoming notifications (display alerts, update UI).
UI: Update order status text/indicators, animate driver icon on map, display ETAs dynamically.
Technical Specifications Compliance
Swift Version: 5.5+ (required for async/await). Use latest stable Swift version.

Async/Await: Refactor networking calls, asynchronous tasks within ViewModels and Services to use async/await where it simplifies logic compared to complex Combine chains. Use Task { } for launching asynchronous work from synchronous contexts (like button actions).

Offline Capabilities:

Cache read-only data (e.g., user profile, vehicle list, past orders) using Core Data, Realm, or simple Property List/JSON file caching.

Display cached data when offline.

Disable actions requiring network connectivity (e.g., placing new order) and provide clear offline indicators.

Consider queuing order requests made offline for submission when connectivity returns (complex, potentially post-MVP).

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling (see Section 9).

Loading States: Use @State variables in Views or @Published in ViewModels to track loading status. Display ProgressView or placeholder views (e.g., using .redacted(reason: .placeholder)).

Dark/Light Mode: Use adaptive colors (Asset Catalog), system materials, and test thoroughly in both modes. Leverage @Environment(.colorScheme).

Accessibility: Use standard SwiftUI controls, provide accessibility labels, hints, and values. Support Dynamic Type. Test with VoiceOver.

UI/UX Requirements
Interface: Minimalist design, clear visual hierarchy, ample white space. Focus on ease of use for the primary task (ordering fuel).

Navigation: Use standard SwiftUI navigation (NavigationView, .sheet, .fullScreenCover, TabView if appropriate). Ensure predictable back navigation.

Responsiveness: Test on various iPhone screen sizes and orientations (where applicable). Use adaptive layouts (e.g., GeometryReader, LazyVGrid).

Animations: Use subtle SwiftUI animations (withAnimation, .transition, .matchedGeometryEffect) to enhance user experience, not distract.

Feedback: Provide clear visual feedback for actions (button states, loading indicators, success messages/checkmarks, error alerts).

Branding: Consistently apply AutoFill logo, color palette, and typography.

Integration Requirements
RESTful API: Implement a NetworkService layer using URLSession with async/await. Define clear API contracts (request/response models matching backend). Base URL configuration for different environments (dev, staging, prod).

WebSocket: Implement a WebSocketService to manage connection lifecycle and message handling (sending/receiving JSON payloads).

Push Notifications: Configure App ID with Push Notification capability. Set up APNs key/certificate in Apple Developer account. Integrate Firebase SDK for FCM, handle token registration/refresh, and implement UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate methods.

Analytics: Integrate Firebase Analytics SDK. Log key events (signup, login, vehicle added, order placed, payment success/failure) with relevant parameters.

Crash Reporting: Integrate Firebase Crashlytics. Ensure dSYMs are uploaded for symbolication.

Performance Monitoring: Integrate Firebase Performance Monitoring to track network request times, app startup, and screen rendering performance.

Security Requirements
Data Storage: Use Keychain for sensitive data (auth tokens, potentially saved payment method identifiers if not solely managed by Stripe). Avoid storing sensitive info in UserDefaults or plain files.

API Authentication: Send auth token (JWT) in HTTP Authorization header (Bearer scheme) for protected endpoints. Implement token refresh mechanism.

Input Validation: Perform client-side validation (format, required fields) for user input (forms). Crucially, ensure comprehensive server-side validation as client validation can be bypassed.

Payment Handling: Adhere strictly to Stripe SDK integration guidelines to maintain PCI compliance. Never let sensitive card data touch your app/backend directly.

Privacy: Request permissions only when necessary (e.g., location "When In Use"). Clearly state data usage in Privacy Policy. Comply with GDPR/CCPA if applicable.

Data Encryption: Use HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) for all network communication. iOS handles filesystem encryption by default when passcode is set.

Testing Requirements
Unit Tests (XCTest): Test ViewModels (mocking service dependencies), Services (mocking network layer), utility functions, data transformations. Aim for high code coverage (>70-80%) for core logic.

UI Tests (XCTest): Test critical user flows (login, add vehicle, place order). Use accessibility identifiers for stable element selection. Can be slower and more brittle, focus on essential paths.

Integration Tests: Test interactions between layers (e.g., ViewModel calling real Service with mocked network responses).

Network Mocking: Use libraries like OHHTTPStubs or custom URLProtocol subclasses to mock network responses during tests, ensuring predictable behavior regardless of actual backend status.

Test Coverage: Configure Xcode scheme to gather code coverage data. Regularly review reports.

Dependency Injection: Use constructor injection primarily for ViewModels and Services. Consider a simple manual DI container or environment objects for injecting shared services (@EnvironmentObject). Avoid singletons where possible.

Design Guidelines
HIG Adherence: Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for layout, navigation, controls, and interaction patterns.

Consistency: Maintain uniform spacing, padding, typography (SF Symbols, system fonts), and component styling throughout the app.

System Components: Prefer standard SwiftUI controls (Button, TextField, List, NavigationLink, etc.) over custom ones unless necessary for branding or specific functionality.

Color Schemes: Define primary, secondary, accent, background, and text colors in the Asset Catalog with variants for Light and Dark Mode.

Contrast: Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum) for text and interactive elements for accessibility.

Error Handling
Strategy: Define custom Error enums for different domains (e.g., NetworkError, AuthError, OrderError).

User Feedback: Catch errors in ViewModels. Update state variables (@Published var errorMessage: String?). Display user-friendly messages in SwiftUI Views using .alert or custom error views. Avoid showing raw technical error details.

Network Errors: Handle specific errors like no internet connection (URLError.notConnectedToInternet), timeouts, server errors (5xx), client errors (4xx - especially auth errors 401/403).

Retry Mechanisms: Implement retry logic for transient network errors (e.g., simple retry button, potentially exponential backoff for certain background tasks).

Logging: Log detailed error information (including context, stack traces if available) using OSLog or a remote logging service (like Firebase Crashlytics non-fatal error reporting) for debugging purposes.

Performance Requirements
Launch Time: Optimize by minimizing work in AppDelegate/App init, deferring non-essential initializations. Aim for < 2 seconds.

Scrolling: Ensure smooth 60fps scrolling in lists (List, ScrollView) by using efficient data loading, view reuse (intrinsic to SwiftUI List), avoiding heavy computations on the main thread, and optimizing image loading/resizing (e.g., using AsyncImage correctly).

Memory: Profile using Instruments (Allocations, Leaks). Avoid retain cycles (especially with Combine subscriptions - use .store(in: &cancellables)). Release resources appropriately.

Battery: Profile using Xcode Energy Impact gauge. Minimize background processing, optimize location updates (desiredAccuracy, distanceFilter, use allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates judiciously), reduce network polling (prefer push/WebSockets).

Caching: Implement caching for network responses (URLCache), images, and frequently accessed data to reduce network load and improve perceived speed.

Network Efficiency: Batch API calls where possible. Request only necessary data fields. Use efficient data formats (JSON).

Deliverables
Complete Source Code: Well-commented Swift code following the structure outlined above. Includes project files (.xcodeproj, .xcworkspace).

README.md: Detailed instructions for project setup, building, running, environment configuration (API keys, base URLs), and dependencies.

API Integration Documentation: Clear documentation (or reference to backend docs) detailing required API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods used by the app.

Testing Documentation: Overview of testing strategy, instructions for running unit and UI tests, and summary of test coverage.

Build Configuration Files: .xcconfig files for managing build settings across different environments (Debug, Release, Staging).

Asset Files: All required assets (images, icons, fonts) organized in Assets.xcassets and resource folders.

Third-Party Dependency List: List of all external libraries/SDKs used (e.g., Stripe, Firebase SDKs, potentially others) including versions, managed via Swift Package Manager (preferred) or CocoaPods.

Known Issues and Limitations: A document outlining any known bugs, limitations, or areas for future improvement identified during development.

This plan provides a robust technical foundation for building the AutoFill iOS app using modern SwiftUI practices. Adhering to these guidelines will result in a high-quality, maintainable, and scalable application.
